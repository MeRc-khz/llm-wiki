# The Savage Dad Style Guide

## I. Brand Foundation & Voice

### 1. Brand Persona
The "Savage Dad" is defined by resilience, faith, and unapologetic protection. The voice must reflect the authority of a survivor and the charisma of a community leader.

| Trait | Description | Voice Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Street Authenticity** | A survivor and father rooted in the inner-city streets of Hip Hop America. | Direct, Unapologetic, No Bullshit. Avoid corporate jargon. Use active, firm language. |
| **Renaissance Man** | A Generation X survivor, African American, Hip Hop Head, Sneaker Freak, and Tech Prepper. | Witty, Knowledgeable, Confident. Speak with the authority of someone who knows the drop and is ahead of the curve. |
| **Protective Patriarch** | Strong moral values, a love for God, and an unwavering commitment to family. | Charismatic, Encouraging, Trustworthy. The tone is mentoring and ensures the user feels respected and secure. |

### 2. Tone and Messaging Guidelines
- **Landing Page/Marketing:** Bold, Provocative, Confident.
  - *Example:* "You Know The Rules. Don't Sleep On The Drop."
- **Call to Action (CTAs):** Commanding, Branded, Urgent.
  - *Example:* "Secure The Bag," "Make It Yours," "See The Latest Drop."
- **Success Messages:** Confident Acknowledgment.
  - *Example:* "Secured. That’s going straight to the cart."
- **Error/Validation:** Corrective, Firm, but Relatable.
  - *Example:* "Whoa, check that email again, pops."
- **Transactional Email:** Respectful, Clear, Authoritative.
  - *Example:* "Your Order Is Locked In. Stay Ready."

## II. Visual Identity

### 1. Color Palette
The palette is built around the strong contrast of urban black/charcoal, the energy of Sunburn Orange, and the grounding of Earthy Tan. All colors adhere to M3 accessibility standards.

| Role | Color Name | Hex Value (Light Mode) | Hex Value (Dark Mode) | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | Sunburn Orange (Active) | `#A63E00` | `#FFB683` | Main branding, carousel pagination, active states, loading indicators. |
| **Secondary** | Earthy Tan (Muted) | `#6F5C40` | `#DBC0A3` | Secondary navigation, background accents, subtle borders, newsletter signup fields. |
| **Action/CTA** | Reflective Silver | `#EAEAEA` | `#FFFFFF` | HIGH-PRIORITY BUTTONS ONLY. Ensures maximum contrast on the black theme. |
| **Background** | Street Wear Black | `#FFF8F5` | `#1F1B16` | The foundation of the theme. Dark Mode (charcoal/near-black) is the primary aesthetic. |
| **On Background** | Silver/White Text | `#1F1B16` | `#EBE1D9` | Primary body text and content. |
| **Success** | Muted Olive | `#7CB342` | `#A8D773` | Order confirmations, successful form submissions. |
| **Error** | Crimson Red | `#D32F2F` | `#FFB4AB` | Invalid form inputs, checkout failures, stock warnings. |

### 2. Typography
A powerful pairing of an aggressive display font for impact and a modernistic, legible font for reading.

| Usage | Font Family | Style/Vibe | Weight | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Headings (H1, H2, H3)** | Bangers (or Graffiti/BMX) | Aggressive, Energetic, Unapologetic. | Regular | Used sparingly for maximum impact (Landing Page CTA, Product Titles). |
| **Body Text** | Roboto | Modern, Clean, Legible (Modernistic). | Regular, Medium, Bold | Used for all functional text: body copy, product descriptions, navigation links, and form fields. |

#### Typography Scale
- **Display (H1):** Bangers, 48px, Regular
- **Headline (H2):** Bangers, 32px, Regular
- **Subhead (H3/H4):** Roboto, 20px, Medium
- **Body Text:** Roboto, 16px, Regular
- **Button/CTA:** Roboto, 14px, Bold

### 3. Imagery and Media
- **Style:** High-contrast street photography. Moody, raw, with deep shadows and strong, directional lighting. Avoid brightly lit studio shots.
- **Color Grading:** Slightly desaturated, with `#CC5500` (Sunburn Orange) and `#D2B48C` (Earthy Tan) naturally emphasized in the background or environment.
- **Subject:** Models should embody the persona: confident, determined, and in authentic inner-city/street environments.
- **Product Shots:** Product images should use a clean, charcoal gray or black background to ensure the apparel itself remains the focus, while maintaining the overall dark theme.

## III. PWA Component Library & Patterns (Using Material 3)

### 1. Layout and Grid
- **Grid:** Standard 12-column grid for flexible, responsive content layouts.
- Spacing: Use an 8-point system for all spacing (padding and margins) to ensure vertical and horizontal rhythm consistency.
- **Theme:** The PWA will primarily use the Dark Mode M3 theme (`#1F1B16` Background) to match the "Street Wear Black" aesthetic.

### 2. Core Components

| Component | Style Rules (M3 Application) | Savage Dad Customization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Secondary Buttons** | M3 Outlined button style. | Uses Primary (`#FFB683`) color for the stroke and text. Used for "Add to Cart" or secondary actions. |
| **Product Cards** | M3 Card/Surface component. Elevated with subtle shadow. | Uses the Surface (`#2B2723`) background. Headers (product names) use Bangers for impact. |
